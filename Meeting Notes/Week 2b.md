### <b> Learning Outcomes (What/Why/How) </b>


The user will learn basic english words related to conversation and daily use.
 - Many individuals seek tools that aid in language acquisition of basic english
 - The words are learned by word association through a selection game where the user is given a word in their native language and then must choose the correct corresponding english word

The user will refine their comprehension skills by accurately selecting the most appropriate english word corresponding to the given word in their native language
 - This reinforces their understanding of language and improves their ability to interpret and respond effectively in communication contexts. 
 - This is achieved through iterative gameplay sessions where users encounter various word pairs to increase vocabulary retention

The user will gradually improve their associations with their native language and the correct english word 
 - In addition to learning, itâ€™s important for users learning a new language to create mental associations with words to improve retention and recall
 - Through the process of trial and error in the game the user will improve the association with their native language and english. Overall this facilitates long-term retention of vocabulary. A feedback mechanic where the definition of an incorrect and correct choice may be given to provide users with immediate guidance and feedback as well.


<b>Have you set up a Kanban board with tasks? </b>
<b>Have you allocated team roles?</b>
<b>Have you decided on your Minimum Viable Product?</b>
-Minimum Viable Product (MVP) outline for the language learning game:

Features Across 10 Levels:

Level 1:
Displaying the game's title prominently.
Including an appealing visual design.
Addition of a start button that initiates the transition to the gameplay screen

Level 2:
Creating an engaging space scene with visually appealing planets.
Designing of a spaceship at the bottom that is easily recognizable.
The current level or the round will be clearly displayed
The Chinese/French word will be prominently shown at the top.

Level 3:
The objective should be clearly communicated  to the player: shoot the correct English-named planet.
Providing an intuitive visual cue for the target planet.

Level 4:
Allows left and right movement for the spaceship.
Integrate a shoot button for firing.

Level 5:
Creating visually appealing explosions when a planet is hit.
Ensuring a smooth transition and animation for the destruction of planets.

Level 6 :

Level 7:
Incorporating a timer per round or consider implementing levels.
Increasing difficulty over time by speeding up planet movement or introducing more planets.

Level 8:
