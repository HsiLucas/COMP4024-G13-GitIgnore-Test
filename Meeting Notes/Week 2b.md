### <b> Learning Outcomes (What/Why/How) </b>


The user will learn basic english words related to conversation and daily use.
 - Many individuals seek tools that aid in language acquisition of basic english
 - The words are learned by word association through a selection game where the user is given a word in their native language and then must choose the correct corresponding english word

The user will refine their comprehension skills by accurately selecting the most appropriate english word corresponding to the given word in their native language
 - This reinforces their understanding of language and improves their ability to interpret and respond effectively in communication contexts. 
 - This is achieved through iterative gameplay sessions where users encounter various word pairs to increase vocabulary retention

The user will gradually improve their associations with their native language and the correct english word 
 - In addition to learning, itâ€™s important for users learning a new language to create mental associations with words to improve retention and recall
 - Through the process of trial and error in the game the user will improve the association with their native language and english. Overall this facilitates long-term retention of vocabulary. A feedback mechanic where the definition of an incorrect and correct choice may be given to provide users with immediate guidance and feedback as well.
